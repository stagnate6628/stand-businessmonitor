# stand-businessmonitor
An alternative Business Monitor for Stand

Differences from MusinessBanager Monitor:
- more visible business monitoring
- customization options
- arcade/agency/acid lab views
- does not include ceo warehouses

# Installation
You can download the repository as [zip](https://github.com/stagnate6628/stand-businessmonitor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or the latest lua file found [here](https://github.com/stagnate6628/stand-businessmonitor/releases).

Either way, drag `BusinessMonitor.pluto` to `%appdata%\Stand\Lua Scripts` and run, no additional files required.
