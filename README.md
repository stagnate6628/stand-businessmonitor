# stand-businessmonitor
An alternative Business Monitor for Stand

Differences from MusinessBanager Monitor:
- more visible overlay/doesn't compromise display
- customization options (*some values don't really adapt well to changes, but for the most part work fine*)
- arcade/agency/acid lab monitors
- doesn't include ceo warehouses monitors
