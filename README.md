# stand-businessmonitor
An alternative business monitor for Stand

**How does this differ from the monitors found in MusinessBanager?**
- better business monitor customizability and contrast
    - some qol that might be expected from an overlay
- views for arcade and agency safes, acid lab
- does not include ceo warehouses

**If it is not clear enough already, this does not apply any modifications to your businesses**
